# Solving \(f(x) = g(x)\) Using Newton's Method

## Description

Dynamic web application designed to visually demonstrate the process of finding the intersection points of two mathematical functions, \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\), using Newton's Method. This tool provides an interactive and educational experience, ideal for students and educators in mathematics and computer science.

The application plots both functions on a graph and marks the solution where \(f(x) = g(x)\) after a specified number of iterations of Newton's Method. Users can visually explore how the numerical method converges to the solution, with detailed iteration data displayed in a table format. The interface is styled with a modern dark theme to enhance readability and visual appeal.

## Features

- **Function Plotting**: Graphs of \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) are plotted dynamically.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Highlights the final solution point on the graph where the functions intersect.
- **Detailed Iteration Table**: Displays the steps of Newton's Method in a tabular format for better understanding.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for learning and teaching numerical methods and calculus concepts.

## Use Cases

- **Education**: Great for classrooms and online courses to teach numerical methods.
- **Learning**: A helpful tool for students to understand the iterative process of Newton's Method.
- **Visualization**: Provides a clear visual representation of function intersections and numerical convergence.
